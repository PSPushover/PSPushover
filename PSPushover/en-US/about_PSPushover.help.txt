SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Send Push notifications to your mobile devices through Pushover.net 
    from PowerShell.  

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Send Push notifications to your mobile devices through Pushover.net 
    from PowerShell. Send messages through the console, send status reports
    at the end of your long running scripts, or build custom pager rules 
    for your services. 

    To begin start with the Save-PushoverAPIInformation cmdlet. This takes 
    in your App Token and User Key. 

    To get your User Key go to https://pushover.net/ and sign in. To create a 
    new App go to https://pushover.net/apps/build and make sure to save the 
    App Token. 

    From there you can run Get-PushoverUserDevice to see which devices you
    can target in your alert. Send-PushoverMessage supports the Pushover 
    API for sending messages.
